# Python Flask Web Development Projects

These python GUI projects are built in correspondence with " [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) " course. This course was taught by London's App Brewery top instructor Angela Yang.<br/>

Each project has been built from scratch with minimal to no assistance.<br/>

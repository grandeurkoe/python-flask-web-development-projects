# Python Flask Web Development Projects

These python Flask web development projects are built in correspondence with " [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) " course. This course was taught by London's App Brewery top instructor Angela Yang.<br/>

Each project has been built from scratch with minimal to no assistance.<br/>

### Day 054 - Python Decorator

This project involves constructing your own custom python decorator. 

Here, we created a delay constructor that prints "How are you?" after a 2 second delay.

### Day 055 - Higher or Lower URLs

This project simulates a Higher or Lower URLs website using the Flask framework. Generate a random integer using the randint() function from the random module. This random integer is the number that the player has to guess.

Website Navigation:
- The Higher or Lower URLs website is running on a development server that Flask ships with.
- Use the "/" route to navigate to the homepage.
- Use the "/guessed_number" route to play the  Higher or Lower URLs game. Get the guessed_number as user input.
- If the guessed_number is less than the correct number, then display a webpage with "Too low, try again!" red heading and a funny GIF.
- If the guessed_number is greater than the correct number, then display a webpage with "Too high, try again!" purple heading and a funny GIF.
- If the guessed_number is correct, then display a webpage with "You found me!" green heading and a funny GIF.
